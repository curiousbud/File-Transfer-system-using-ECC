## üîê **Core Security Features** (5 minutes)

### **1. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**
> "At the heart of Qubix is Elliptic Curve Cryptography - the same technology used by Bitcoin, government agencies, and major tech companies."

**Why ECC?**
- **Smaller Keys, Same Security**: 256-bit ECC = 3072-bit RSA security
- **Faster Performance**: 10x faster than equivalent RSA operations
- **Lower Power Consumption**: Perfect for mobile and IoT devices
- **Future-Proof**: Resistant to quantum computing advances

**Supported Curves:**
- **NIST P-256** (secp256r1) - Industry standard, NSA Suite B approved
- **NIST P-384** (secp384r1) - High-security applications
- **secp256k1** - Bitcoin-compatible for blockchain integration

### **2. Hybrid Encryption Architecture**
> "We combine the best of both worlds: ECC for key exchange and symmetric encryption for data."

**How It Works:**
1. **Key Exchange**: ECC generates shared secrets between users
2. **Data Encryption**: AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypts files
3. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each session uses ephemeral keys
4. **Authenticated Encryption**: Guarantees both privacy and integrity

**Algorithms Supported:**
- **AES-256-GCM**: NIST standard, hardware accelerated
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Google's high-performance alternative

### **3. Advanced Key Management**
> "Security is only as strong as your key management - we've made it bulletproof yet user-friendly."

**Features:**
- **Secure Generation**: Hardware random number generators
- **Protected Storage**: PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations
- **Key Rotation**: Automated and manual rotation capabilities
- **Backup & Recovery**: Secure key backup with user-controlled passwords

## üìã **Q&A Preparation**

### **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

**Q: How does this compare to existing solutions like Dropbox or Google Drive?**
A: Traditional cloud providers encrypt data *for* you but can still access it. Qubix implements true end-to-end encryption where only you and your recipients can decrypt files. Even if our servers were compromised, your data remains protected.

**Q: What about performance? Doesn't encryption slow things down?**
A: Modern hardware-accelerated AES and optimized ECC operations make encryption negligible. Our benchmarks show 8-12ms per MB - faster than most network transfers. Plus, we use concurrent processing for batch operations.

**Q: How do you handle key management at scale?**
A: We implement enterprise-grade key rotation, secure backup, and recovery systems. Keys are encrypted with PBKDF2 using 600,000 iterations. For enterprises, we support HSM integration and automated key lifecycle management.

**Q: What about compliance requirements?**
A: Qubix implements NIST-approved algorithms and can meet FIPS 140-2 requirements. The audit logging and access controls support GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX compliance needs.

**Q: How extensible is the system?**
A: Very. Our modular architecture supports new encryption algorithms, custom authentication systems, and third-party integrations through our API. The open-source model allows complete customization.

**Q: What's your security model against quantum computing?**
A: While current ECC curves remain secure for decades, we're implementing post-quantum cryptography algorithms like Kyber and Dilithium. Our hybrid architecture makes algorithm transitions seamless.
